Hi, i'm victoria! You might recognize me from the Rust community, where i helped maintain the
`rustdoc` tool, and the `docs.rs` documentation hosting service.  I've also written some other Rust
libraries, and even written some not-Rust things for dayjobs and other personal projects. Thanks for
stopping by!

In a past life, I hung out in chiptune communities and wrote some covers as [icesoldier][].
If you knew me before 2015 that's the alias I would have used.
