Hi, i'm grey! I write some Rust in my downtime. You may have seen me around Twitter, rambling about
rustdoc. I'm one of it's official maintainers. I've also written some other Rust libraries, and even
written some not-Rust things for dayjobs and other personal projects. Thanks for stopping by!

In a past life, I hung out in chiptune communities and wrote some covers as [icesoldier][].
If you knew me before 2015 that's the alias I would have used.
